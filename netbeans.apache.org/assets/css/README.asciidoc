= Foundation 6 CSS

This site currently uses Foundation 6 CSS, using https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/xy-grid.html[the XY Grid], and
the font awesome icon font.

A simple `Makefile` uses the command line sass compiler (https://github.com/sass/sassc) to create a compressed `netbeans.css`.

TODO: Compile netbeans.scss using Java (remove dependency with sassc command line compiler).
