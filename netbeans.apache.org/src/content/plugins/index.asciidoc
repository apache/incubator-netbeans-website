== Apache NetBeans Plugins

The NetBeans IDE and the NetBeans Platform are built on top of a modular architecture, and can be enhanced with plugins. 

We are currently transitioning the plugin portal to the new Apache infrastructure. Some plugins won't be able to be hosted in Apache infrastructure due to licensing issues.

Apache NetBeans 9.0 Beta uses the same update center as in previous versions, so you should be able to install plugins (hosted outside the Apache infrastructure) designed for previous versions of NetBeans. You will be asked to accept the appropriate license agreement for any plugins you install.

Please visit the previous link:http://plugins.netbeans.org/PluginPortal/[NetBeans Plugin Portal] for more information about NetBeans plugins.
