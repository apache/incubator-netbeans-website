== Building from source

You can of course build Apache NetBeans from source. To do so:

. Clone the https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans GitHub repository.
. Install Oracle's Java 8 or Open JDK v8.
. Install Apache Ant 1.10 or greater (https://ant.apache.org/).

Once you're all set just enter the `incubator-netbeans` directory and type:

- `ant` to build the Apache NetBeans IDE.
  ** Once built, the IDE bits are placed in the `./nbbuild/netbeans` directory. You can run the IDE from within the `incubator-netbeans` directory by typing `./nbbuild/netbeans/bin/netbeans` on unixes (for Windows the command is equivalent).
- `ant tryme` to run the Apache NetBeans IDE.

For details, go here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Development+Environment

Now that you have built Apache NetBeans from source you may want to link:/participate/submit-pr.html[submit a pull request].
