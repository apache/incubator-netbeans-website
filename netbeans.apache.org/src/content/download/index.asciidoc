Apache NetBeans is released four times a year. Our April release is a
long-term support (LTS) release that benefits from our famous NetCAT
community testing process, and will remain available and supported for
a year.  Our other quarterly releases provide early access to new
features. See link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Release+Schedule[full release schedule].
