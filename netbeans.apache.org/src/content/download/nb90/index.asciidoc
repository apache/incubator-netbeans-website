== Apache NetBeans IDE (incubating) 9.0 

Apache NetBeans 9.0 is the first release of the Apache NetBeans IDE.

The main goals for this release are

- IP clearance of the Oracle code donation.
- Java 9 Support.

=== Downloads

- See link:/download/nb90/nb90-beta.html[Apache NetBeans 9.0 Beta], released on february, 2018.

=== Features

NOTE: This is a list of the *proposed* features of Apache NetBeans 9.0. The beta release may provide a *subset* of these.

////
To display a feature do as follows:

Add a header title, and an anonymous asciidoc block (--) with the ".feature" metadata, and write text inside the block:

== A title here
[.feature]
--
This is a feature
--

You can add images to the feature by adding a png file along with the document, and adding a image: construct to the text.

Use role="left" for left alignment or role="right" for right alignment.

Examples:

== An amazing feature

Here goes some text

And some more text

And even some more

==== Supporting JPMS (Jigsaw) to full extent
[.feature]
--
image:nb90-module-info.png[Adding module-info.java, title="Adding module-info.java, click to enlarge", role="left", link="nb90-module-info.png"]

NetBeans 9 supports link:http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/spec/[JPMS (Jigsaw)] to full extent. 

Modulepath was added as a crucial paradigm to NetBeans in addition to Classpath.

The standard NetBeans Java SE Project Type (Ant based) can be a single JDK9 module simply by adding a `module-info.java` file into the default package.

Of course, we provide full autocompletion for `module-info.java`
--

==== A brand new Java Modular Application project type
[.feature]
--
image:nb90-new-multi-module.png[Java Modular Application, title="New Java Modular Application Project Type, click to enlarge", role="left", link="nb90-new-multi-module.png"]

We have added a new *Java Modular project* type. This allows to develop
several JDK9 modules in one NetBeans project (Ant based). 

The advantage of this project type over several Java SE projects (each
containing one module) is that dependencies are simply managed by declaring
appropriate `exports` and `requires` in `module-info.java`, and all modules
in the project will be compiled at once.
--

==== Java Shell support
[.feature]
--
Java Shell is a new tool included in JDK9 defined in link:http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/222[JEP 222] to introduce REPL
(read-eval-print-loop) capabilities to Java. 

image:nb90-javashell.png[Java Shell Support, title="Java Shell Support, click to enlarge", role="left", link="nb90-javashell.png"]

NetBeans provides integrated console-like UI for the Java Shell, leveraing NetBeans editor capabilites.

NetBeans can support the tool with the user project configuration, so the Java
Shell is set up to work with project classes and libraries, providing autocompletion out of the box in
the editor.

image:nb90-shell-agent.png[Shell Agent Configuration, title="JShell acess configuration, click to enlarge", role="right", link="nb90-shell-agent.png"]

Also NetBeans greatly extends the capabilities of the commandline tool.
NetBeans can execute the shell *as an agent*, similar to a debugging agent, on the
debugged or run application (currently only J2SE applications are supported,
both Ant and Maven-based).

image:nb90-shell-save.png[Saving JShell snippets, title="Saving JShell snippets, click to enlarge", role="left", link="nb90-shell-save.png"]

Snippets written in JShell can be redefined and tested, even against a running
code. When the prototype is ready, it can be saved to a regular java source file
and integrated with the project.
