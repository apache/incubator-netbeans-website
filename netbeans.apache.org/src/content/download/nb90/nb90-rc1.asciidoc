=== Building from source

. Oracle's Java 8 or Open JDK v8.
. Apache Ant 1.10 or greater (https://ant.apache.org).

Once you have everything installed then:

1. Unzip the source zip file in a directory of your liking.
2. `cd` to that directory, and then run `ant` to build the Apache NetBeans IDE. Once built you can run the IDE by typing `./nbbuild/netbeans/bin/netbeans` (or `.\nbbuild\netbeans\bin\netbeans` in
Windows).
