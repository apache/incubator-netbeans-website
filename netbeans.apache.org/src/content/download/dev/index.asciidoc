:description: Apache NetBeans source and daily builds

All Apache NetBeans source code is freely available to build yourself, or you can
download (unsupported) daily development builds.

== Daily builds

Please visit link:https://builds.apache.org/job/netbeans-linux/[https://builds.apache.org/job/netbeans-linux/] and link:https://builds.apache.org/job/netbeans-windows/[https://builds.apache.org/job/netbeans-windows/] for the daily builds.

== Building from source

You can of course build Apache NetBeans from source. To do so:

. Clone the https://github.com/apache/netbeans GitHub repository.
. Install an LTS release of the Java Development Kit.
. Install Apache Ant 1.10 or greater (https://ant.apache.org/).
. Set JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME appropriately or leave them undefined.

Once you're all set just enter the `netbeans` directory and type:

- `ant build` to build the Apache NetBeans IDE on JDK 8, on JDK 11 also type -Dpermit.jdk9.builds=true with the `ant build` command.
  ** This will build a binary zip bundle of the IDE at `./nbbuild/NetBeans-<version-hash>-release.zip`. Extract that zip in a place of your choosing and run `netbeans/bin/netbeans` (or `netbeans/bin/netbeans.exe` on Windows).
- `ant tryme` to run the Apache NetBeans IDE directly from the build folder rather than the zip for development purposes.

For details, go here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Development+Environment

Now that you have built Apache NetBeans from source you may want to link:/participate/submit-pr.html[submit a pull request].
