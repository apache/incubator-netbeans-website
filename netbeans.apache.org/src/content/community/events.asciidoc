== Apache NetBeans Events

Users and developers either convoke or participate in different events and conferences. 

The Apache Software Foundation makes sure that all organizations are treated
fairly, making sure the project does not favor any commercial entities or
organizations over others.

In order to achieve those goals, the Apache NetBeans Project has to follow
link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/NetBeans+Events[some
guidelines] before announcing or promoting these events.

We are still working out those requirements, this page will then list
events of interest for the NetBeans Community.
