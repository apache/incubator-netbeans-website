This Gulp tasks are part of the Gradle buildSite task and are run at the very end.

If you want to manually run build tasks of all frontend assets, write in the console in the "frontend" directory:

    gulp

If you don't have node_modules then you must run this command in the "frontend" directory to install them:

    npm install

and then:

    gulp
