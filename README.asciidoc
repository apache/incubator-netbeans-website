= Apache NetBeans (incubating) web sites


This repository is structured in different *subdirectories*, for different subdomains.

link:netbeans.apache.org[netbeans.apache.org]:: Main Apache NetBeans website
  - Will be gradually enhanced with content from http://netbeans.org as Oracle approves donation.
  - Once all content is migrated it may become http://netbeans.org

link:bits.netbeans.org[bits.netbeans.org]:: Apache NetBeans API documentation
  - Will be integrated with http://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans
  - Will generate javadocs for each release.

NOTE: This is still *a work in progress*, pending a community approval.
