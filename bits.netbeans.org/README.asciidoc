= bits.netbeans.org

This directory will be responsible for building the bits.netbeans.org website.

It currently has a `build.xml` file that builds the NetBeans javadoc and extracts it in the `javadoc` directory.

== TODO:
  - Improve the `build.xml` file to take into account github branches and NetBeans releases.
  - Build javadoc zip files?
  - Build other parts of http://bits.netbeans.org
  - Publish this somewhere (http://bits.apache.netbeans.org?)
